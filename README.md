# Calculator
This is not what many would call a conventional calculator. Upon startup it creates a 1000x1000x1 matrix using folders for the first two dimensions
and files for the last dimension. The name of that file is the sum of the two folders before it.
#### EX:
    ├── 10                    
        ├── 20
            └── 30
